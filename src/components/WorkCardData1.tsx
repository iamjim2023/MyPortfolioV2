      "Another mistake that is often committed by beginners in the journey of learning Web Development is they directly go out to build some complex and advanced-level projects. And it eventually results in several unwanted outcomes such as loss of interest & motivation, inconsistency, etc. Instead of abruptly looking forward to building a full-fledged website like Flipkart or Facebook, what beginners are required to do is start with the basic projects and get practical exposure to the fundamental concepts & technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, etc. first and then can proceed to the intermediate and advanced level projects.",
